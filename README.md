# optimization_so4
These codes are optimizated SO4 hygrocopycity.
RA is a code to calculate hygroscopicity of sulfate aerosols using the information of ammonium-to-sulfate ratio.
LO is a code to calculate hygroscopicity of sulfate aerosols using the distinct distribution of ammonium and sulfate.

This code works best with WRF-Chem v3.8.1
WRF-Chem source code is available at https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources.html

## Installation of the new codes
- first, download WRF source code.
- then, put fortran codes provided in this github repository in the `chem/` folder
- install WRF-Chem
